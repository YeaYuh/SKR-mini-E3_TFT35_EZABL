_Marlin_ is a firmware for RepRap machines, also known as _3D printers_. firmware to the next level by adding support for much faster 32-bit and ARM-based boards while improving support for 8-bit AVR boards through the use of a "hardware abstraction layer."

Additional documentation can be found at the [Marlin Home Page](http://marlinfw.org/).
Please let us know if Marlin misbehaves in any way. Volunteers are standing by!

## Building Marlin 2.0

To build Marlin you'll need [Arduino IDE 1.8.8 or newer](https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software) or [PlatformIO](http://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/ide.html#platformio-ide) with _[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)_.

- [Installing Marlin (VSCode)](http://marlinfw.org/docs/basics/install_platformio_vscode.html).

## Current Target

Creality Ender-3 with SKR Mini E3 v1.2 , EZABL, and TFT35

Marlin is published under the [GPL license](/LICENSE) because we believe in open development. The GPL comes with both rights and obligations. Whether you use Marlin firmware as the driver for your open or closed-source product, you must keep Marlin open, and you must provide your compatible Marlin source code to end users upon request. The most straightforward way to comply with the Marlin license is to make a fork of Marlin on Github, perform your modifications, and direct users to your modified fork.

While we can't prevent the use of this code in products (3D printers, CNC, etc.) that are closed source or crippled by a patent, we would prefer that you choose another firmware or, better yet, make y
